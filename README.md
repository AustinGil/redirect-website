A simple project to generate an index.html file that will redirect to another URL.

1. Copy `index.html.template` to `index.html`
2. Replace all instances of `https://example.com` with your URL.

Or you can run the `copy-replace.sh` script if you prefer the terminal: `bash copy-replace.sh https://yourdomain.com`

Once youre finished, you can upload it directly to a host like Netlify to test out how it works.
